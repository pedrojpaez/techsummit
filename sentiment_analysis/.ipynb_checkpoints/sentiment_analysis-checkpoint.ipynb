    "# Sentiment Analysis by Fine-tuning Word Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered some advanced topics using advanced models, let's return to the basics and show how these techniques can help us even when addressing the comparatively simple problem of classification. In particular, we'll look at the classic problem of sentiment analysis: taking an input consisting of a string of text and classifying its sentiment as positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to use GluonNLP to build a sentiment analysis model whose weights are initialized based on a pre-trained language model. Using pre-trained language model weights is a common approach for semi-supervised learning in NLP. In order to do a good job with large language modeling on a large corpus of text, our model must learn representations that contain information about the structure of natural language. Intuitively, by starting with these good features, versus simply random features, we're able to converge faster towards a superior model for our downstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "With GluonNLP, we can quickly prototype the model and it's easy to customize. The building process consists of just three simple steps. For this demonstration we'll focus on movie reviews from the Large Movie Review Dataset, also known as the IMDB dataset. Given a movie, our model will output prediction of its sentiment, which can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we must load the required modules. Please remember to download the archive from the top of this tutorial\n",
    "if you'd like to follow along. We set the random seed so the outcome can be relatively consistent."

    "## Sentiment analysis model with pre-trained language model encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "So that we can easily transplant the pre-trained weights, we'll base our model architecture on the pre-trained language model (LM). Following the LSTM layer, we have one representation vector for each word in the sentence. Because we plan to make a single prediction (as opposed to one per word), we'll first pool our predictions across time steps before feeding them through a dense last layer to produce our final prediction (a single sigmoid output node).\n",
    "\n",
    "![sa-model](samodel-v3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, our model represents input words by their embeddings. Following the embedding layer, our model consists of a two-layer LSTM, followed by an average pooling layer, followed by a sigmoid output layer (all illustrated in the figure above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, given an input sequence, the memory cells in the LSTM layer will produce a representation sequence. This representation sequence is then averaged over all time steps resulting in a fixed-length sentence representation $h$. Finally, we apply a sigmoid output layer on top of $h$. We’re using the sigmoid activation function because we’re trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. A sigmoid activation function squashes the output values to the range [0,1], allowing us to interpret this output as a probability, making our lives relatively simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we define our `MeanPoolingLayer` and basic sentiment analysis network's (`SentimentNet`) structure."

Good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed .. well earlier than <unk> hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and Love this movie just as much as i did .
